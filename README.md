# Nuxt AutoSave

This extension automatically saves dirty `.ts` files inside the `.nuxt` folder that are unexpectedly opened in VS Code after Nuxt updates them.

It prevents the `components.d.ts` file and similar from blocking Git commits or popping up in the editor as unsaved.

This extension runs silently in the backgroundâ€”no UI or commands required.
